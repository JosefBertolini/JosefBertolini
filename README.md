# Welcome ðŸ‘‹

My name, as you can tell from my username, is Josef Bertolini. I am currently a Senior at UCI majoring in Computer Game Science and doubling in a Computer Science degree specializing in Systems Programming. 

### Current Projects:
  * A C++ Desktop Application that tracks macro-nutrients every day
  * Recreating old C++ Homework in Rust

### Currently Learning:
  * The Rust Programming Language
  * Unreal Engine 4
  * How to be good at Rainbow 6: Siege

### Potential Future Projects:
  * A Chip-8 Emulator
  * A Detective RPG
  * Whatever projects I get assigned
  * A Game Engine (way down the line, but something I would want to ultimately make)
